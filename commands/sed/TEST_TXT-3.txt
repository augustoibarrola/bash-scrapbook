But how did it all begin? A group of girls were playing by the river,
picking flowers. Again and again such scenes were to prove irresistible
to the gods. Persephone was carried off “while playing with the girls
with the deep cleavages.” She too had been gathering flowers: roses,
crocuses, violets, irises, hyacinths, narcissi. But mainly narcissi,
“that wondrous, radiant flower, awesome to the sight of gods and mortals
alike.” Thalia was playing ball in a field of flowers on the mountainside
when she was clutched by an eagle’s claws: Zeus again. Creusa felt Apollo’s
hands lock around her wrists as she bent to pick saffron on the slopes of 
the Athens Acropolis. Europa and her friends were likewise gathering narcissi,
hyacinths, violets, roses, thyme.”
